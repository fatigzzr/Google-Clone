## 1. Introduction
HTML5 works hand in hand with CSS3 to create web pages that we use every day in the browser. Even this website where you are viewing this content is built with HTML and CSS.

In this project, with the knowledge of HTML and CSS, I cloned the Google interface.

## 2. What I built
In this project I focused on building the clone of the Google interface.
Contains the following sections:

* **Header**: Section involving my profile picture, icons, and a hyperlinked menu.

* **Main**: Container section for the central elements of the page: logo, search bar, icons and buttons.

* **Footer**: Section that includes hyperlinks at the bottom of the page.

## 3. Project's Objective: 
Learn to use standard HTML5 tags and CSS3 styles.
